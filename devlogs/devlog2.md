## Devlog Entry - 11/28

### How we satisfied the software requirements
For each of the F0 requirements, give a paragraph of explanation for how your game’s implementation satisfies the requirements.
Your team can earn partial credit for covering only a subset of the F0 requirements at this stage. (It is much better to satisfy the requirements in a sloppy way right now than lock in your partial credit.)

**[F0.a] You control a character moving on a 2D grid.**\

**[F0.b] You advance time in the turn-based simulation manually.**\

**[F0.c] You can reap (gather) or sow (plant) plants on the grid when your character is near them.**\

**[F0.d] Grid cells have sun and water levels. The incoming sun and water for each cell is somehow randomly generated each turn. Sun energy cannot be stored in a cell (it is used immediately or lost) while water moisture can be slowly accumulated over several turns.**\

**[F0.e] Each plant on the grid has a type (e.g. one of 3 species) and a growth level (e.g. “level 1”, “level 2”, “level 3”).**\

**[F0.f] Simple spatial rules govern plant growth based on sun, water, and nearby plants (growth is unlocked by satisfying conditions).**\

**[F0.g] A play scenario is completed when some condition is satisfied (e.g. at least X plants at growth level Y or above).**\


### Reflection
Looking back on how you achieved the F0 requirements, how has your team’s plan changed? Did you reconsider any of the choices you previously described for Tools and Materials or your Roles? It would be very suspicious if you didn’t need to change anything. There’s learning value in you documenting how your team’s thinking has changed over time.
