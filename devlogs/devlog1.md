## Devlog Entry - 11/19

[Back To README](../README.md)

### introducing The Team

* Design Lead: Aaron Bruno (aaronbruno)
* Design Co-Lead: Brandon Jack (Brandonjack9)
* Engine Lead: Joost (Will) Vonk (jwvonk)
* Engine Co-Lead: Brayden Smith (TheRealC3po, bsmit104)
* Tools Lead: Anthony Umemoto (CaptainToTo)

### Tools and Materials

**Library & Platform: Phaser & Github Pages**\
We mainly decided to use Phaser because we are all already familiar with the environment. It also allows us to see the changes we make to the codebase in-browser immediately. Finally, [Phaser Labs](https://labs.phaser.io) provides a rich library of code examples for any number of game mechanics, visual effects, audio effects, etc.

**Languages: Typescript & JSON**\
Typescript is up and coming again as a hot language since the update of Node.js recently. This has brought the language back to many job description requirements as some of the group members here have noticed. This is a good language choice for a portfolio piece. We have also been working with it this quarter since we are comfortable with working in the language. We also plan to have a crispy HTML page that is nicely engaging with a title and other documentation.

**Tools: ESLint, Aesprite/Photoshop, & VSCode**\
We will be using Visual Studio Code because it is the best IDE and we are most familiar/comfortable with it. We will be using Aseprite and/or Photoshop for creating visual assets because most team members are familiar with them and have experience using both.

### Outlook

**What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?**\
We are hoping to accomplish a unique aesthetic with a horror style farming sim which will stick out as opposed to a happy go lucky, calm farming. We also hope to have very nice Phaser code without any code smells that is portfolio worthy.

**What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?**\
Collaborative Coding (Keeping track of whatâ€™s already been done & how to expand it).

**What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?**\
We are hoping to have a portfolio worthy Phaser project with the up and coming popularity of Typescript as the main language.
