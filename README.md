## Outlook

**What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?**\
We are hoping to accomplish a unique aesthetic with a horror style farming sim which will stick out as opposed to a happy go lucky, calm farming. We also hope to have very nice Phaser code without any code smells that is portfolio worthy.

**What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?**\
Collaborative Coding (Keeping track of whatâ€™s already been done & how to expand it).

**What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?**\
We are hoping to have a portfolio worthy Phaser project with the up and coming popularity of Typescript as the main language.
